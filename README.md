# neokortexcouk

This is the website for the neokortex team in the UK demoscene. It is hosted at www.neokortex.co.uk.

## TODOs and possible future enhancements

- **Add partial page loading:** At the moment, each page of the site contains all the HTML for the header, footer and navigation menu. This "works" to get the site up and running initially but we need to factor these elements out into dedicated source files and "build" each page at runtime more intelligently. _(Essentially, I didn't want to get too distracted from the task in hand by looking at JavaScript SPA technologies and routing engines.. But, now we're at version one, it might be worth digging into it a bit more.)_
