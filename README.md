# neokortexcouk

This is the website for the neokortex team in the UK demoscene. It is hosted at www.neokortex.co.uk.

## TODOs and possible future enhancements

- **Add partial page loading:** At the moment, each page of the site contains all the HTML for the header, footer and navigation menu. This "works" to get the site up and running initially but we need to factor these elements out into dedicated source files and "build" each page at runtime more intelligently. _(Essentially, I didn't want to get too distracted from the task in hand by looking at JavaScript SPA technologies and routing engines.. But, now we're at version one, it might be worth digging into it a bit more.)_

- **Verify Amiga ASCII display and add other fonts:** I don't believe the ASCIIs display correctly on all browsers. Probably some encoding issues need troubleshooting (we may need to define an explicit encoding for the page perhaps). Also, we should add other Amiga fonts such as P0T-NOoDLE and MicroKnight, including providing functionality to view each ASCII release in any "compatible" font available.

## Version History

- v1.0.0 - **a glimmer of hope** - _pending release, final touches!_
