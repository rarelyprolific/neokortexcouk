          <font size="2">        
          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">Hi Dick, please introduce yourself.  </font></b>
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>I was one of NFA’s more productive members and apparently Co-Manager which surprised
              the hell outta me. I don’t even remember how I got into the group save that Deck the Ripper would
              sometimes ring me up to talk about stuff.<p>

              I was unemployed for the most part, having junked a crappy office job which gave me plenty of time 
              to tinker with AMOS and then Blitz. I moved about a bit and made a few friends at a computer club
              in Scunthorpe as well as churning out the PD and jiffy trading. I even cracked a game once – someone
              actually posted me the original.<p>

              These days I run a couple of websites as well as doing web work for other people. As long as I don’t
              want to spend too much it’s an easy life.<p>
             
          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">How and when did you find the Amiga scene?</font></b> 
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>Probably via the small ads in the back of Amiga Format, where various dodgy geezers (Deck the
              Ripper, I'm looking at you) would advertise for contacts. I remember getting one Elite contact who was
              obviously visiting a board somewhere, and suddenly I became a hot trader for everyone below me.  Eventually
              Deck dragged me into NFA and I pretty much stayed there.<p>
                     
          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">Name your first prominent memory from the Amiga scene.</font></b>
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>The very first one I saw that wasn't in a shop somewhere.  My friend K, who I've known since
              school, got a 1.2 A500 and I was blown away by stuff like Battlechess. I think at the time I still had a
              C64, and I know K sold his C64 setup to finance the move to the Amiga.<p>

          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">Were you a member of any other groups than NFA?</font></b> 
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>I think we tried to start something called 'Network 12' for all Amiga 1200 owners - packdisks with
              AGA utilities on them, stuff like that. It failed.<p>              

          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">What inspired you to create THE WORD diskmag, even though there were an abundance 
              of diskmags already out there?</font></b>
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>Originally it was meant to be an internal NFA production, but someone leaked it, shoddy interface 
              and all, and suddenly people were asking for the next issue.  #1 and (I think) #2 were absolutely dire, I 
              remember that much.<p>

              That's probably why you can't find them anymore (see www.nfa.org.uk).  The interfaces were incredibly basic
              because, after all, who'd see them?<p>

          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">Apart from THE WORD, name some of your favourite projects that you produced with
              NFA</font></b>
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>Balls! was a good one, not least because it made me some money, but the one people remember most
              was the Bodyshop AGA slideshows - a collection of nice booby pics on a disk or two in slideshow format.<p>
              Apparently even FAST said they liked them, while they were in the process of raiding some of NFA.<p>         

          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">Name some of your favourite demoscene productions/groups.</font></b>
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>Sanity, Silents and Scoopex all released outstanding stuff. The Sanity "World of Commodore" demo 
              was my all time favourite, I think.  Melon were (and still are) kings of style - there was nothing quite like 
              their stuff. Makes you wonder what they were smoking.<p>

              There were a couple of apps that were absolutely amazing for the time: zGif was a GIF shower that was about 
              8k in size and incredibly fast, and Stonecracker was a compression algorithm that could decrunch over itself, 
              saving loads of memory. I think I employed both of those on The Word eventually.<p>

          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">The Word was coded using good old AMOS. In three words, how would you sum up
              AMOS?</font></b>
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>Easy.  Clunky.  Hackable.<p>                 
        
          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">Are you still in contact with any ex-NFA members or scene pals?</font></b>
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>Phil!98, Bootblock, Aladdin Sane and Daniel Thornton are still in my ever-decreasing circle.  K did
              a Word article on a Phoebe Cates fake image that got into print and he still comes over regularly, but that's 
              about it.<p>

              More recently I spotted Budda/NFA on Twitter and got back in touch there.<p>

          <b> Daz: <font color="#008000">Did you regularly frequent any BBSes? If so, which ones?</font></b>
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>I was never into that part of it.  I think I uploaded an issue of The Word to The Big Hard One, but
              that's about it.<p>

          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">Are you still running any classic Amigas? If so, what models?</font></b>
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>This last year (2013) I’ve spent some of my disposable income on an A1200 which needs a lot of
              attention. It came with 8MB in the trapdoor and a butchered-in 3.5in HD. It’s really a matter of finding time 
              to play with it, though.<p>
         
          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">Were you a regular disk swapper and if so, name (and shame) your favourite
              contacts?</font></b>
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>I was, but I’ll be damned if I can remember anyone in particular.<p>
         
          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">Do you follow the PC demoscene at all?</font></b>
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>I’m not as busy working as I used to be but I still haven’t looked into that. I’m more likely to just
              hit up YouTube and look for demo videos rather than download and run them myself.<p>

          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">You've created a site dedicated to NFA. Does this mean you regularly get nostalgic?
              </font></b> 
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>I’m hankering for the gold old days :)<p>

          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">What inspired you to create the NFA shrine?</font></b> 
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>Literally, the domain was up for sale and it seemed like a good idea at the time. I still need to track
              down a few more titles though.<p>

          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">What exactly does NFA stand for?</font></b> 
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>National Fireplace Association:<br> https://web.archive.org/web/20010614212144/<p>
              Haha.. try this one instead :) : <a href="http://www.nfa.org.uk" target="_blank"> http://www.nfa.org.uk</a><p>

          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">What is your day job?</font></b>
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>I’m a Web Developer. Aside from client work I run a few websites that use either Google AdSense or
              affiliate marketing to earn an income. It pays enough that I don’t have to depend on finding new clients all the
              time so I’m thankful for that.<p>
             
          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">How do you relax/unwind/chill the hell out?</font></b>
          <br> 
          <b> Dick: </b>I like to go camping and have hiked up Ben Nevis a couple of times. Sometimes I’ll just throw the tiny popup 
              tent up in the back garden and sleep outside just for the hell of it.<p>
 
              I also do a lot of reading depending on what interests me at the time. I went through a lot of books on North Korea 
              last year and have recently been catching up with Iain M. Banks’ – especially the Culture novels.<p>

              UK TV is a bit dire these days and I really don’t watch a lot of that. I spend more time watching Japanese and South
              Korean shows via the Internet – SBS’s Running Man is a firm favourite. I also (finally!) signed up to NetFlix so
              there’s that.<p>

          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">What music are you into?</font></b>
          <br> 
          <b> Dick: </b>Dub FX, Dub Mafia, Billy ze Kick.<p>

          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">This is your spam area.. feel free to advertise any web presence, be 
              it Fbook/Twatter/URL/other.</font></b>
          <br>
          <b> Dick: </b>Visit my website, you damned dirty apes! <a href="http://www.dickdolby.co.uk" target="_blank">www.dickdolby.co.uk</a><p>

          <b> DaZ: <font color="#008000">Thanks for taking part in the interview mate. Any final words of wisdom?</font></b>
          <br> 
          <b> Dick: </b>Remember:<p>
              •	Never waste food or money.<br>•	Never mess with someone else's car, money or wife.<br>•	Women are never satisfied. 
              Men can put up with anything.<p>
