            <span class="interview-question"> Hi Dick, please introduce yourself. </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dick:</strong> I was one of NFA’s more productive members and apparently
            Co-Manager which surprised the hell outta me. I don’t even remember how I got into the
            group save that Deck the Ripper would sometimes ring me up to talk about stuff.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was unemployed for the most part, having junked a crappy office job which gave me
            plenty of time to tinker with AMOS and then Blitz. I moved about a bit and made a few
            friends at a computer club in Scunthorpe as well as churning out the PD and jiffy
            trading. I even cracked a game once – someone actually posted me the original.
          </p>

          <p>
            These days I run a couple of websites as well as doing web work for other people. As
            long as I don’t want to spend too much it’s an easy life.
          </p>

            <strong>FuZioN:</strong>
            <span class="interview-question"> How and when did you find the Amiga scene? </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dick:</strong> Probably via the small ads in the back of Amiga Format, where
            various dodgy geezers (Deck the Ripper, I'm looking at you) would advertise for
            contacts. I remember getting one Elite contact who was obviously visiting a board
            somewhere, and suddenly I became a hot trader for everyone below me. Eventually Deck
            dragged me into NFA and I pretty much stayed there.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <p>
            <strong>FuZioN:</strong>
            <span class="interview-question">
              Name your first prominent memory from the Amiga scene.
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dick:</strong> The very first one I saw that wasn't in a shop somewhere. My
            friend K, who I've known since school, got a 1.2 A500 and I was blown away by stuff like
            Battlechess. I think at the time I still had a C64, and I know K sold his C64 setup to
            finance the move to the Amiga.
          </p>

              Were you a member of any other groups than NFA?

            class="right-aligned-image"
          />

          <p>
            <strong>Dick:</strong> I think we tried to start something called 'Network 12' for all
            Amiga 1200 owners - packdisks with AGA utilities on them, stuff like that. It failed.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <p>
            <strong>FuZioN:</strong>
            <span class="interview-question">
              What inspired you to create THE WORD diskmag, even though there were an abundance of
              diskmags already out there?
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dick:</strong> Originally it was meant to be an internal NFA production, but
            someone leaked it, shoddy interface and all, and suddenly people were asking for the
            next issue. #1 and (I think) #2 were absolutely dire, I remember that much.
          </p>

          <p>
            That's probably why you can't find them anymore (see
            <a href="http://www.nfa.org.uk" target="_blank">www.nfa.org.uk</a>). The interfaces were
            incredibly basic because, after all, who'd see them?
          </p>

          <hr />

          <p>
            <strong>FuZioN:</strong>
            <span class="interview-question">
              Apart from THE WORD, name some of your favourite projects that you produced with NFA
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dick:</strong> Balls! was a good one, not least because it made me some money,
            but the one people remember most was the Bodyshop AGA slideshows - a collection of nice
            booby pics on a disk or two in slideshow format.
          </p>

          <p>
            Apparently even FAST said they liked them, while they were in the process of raiding
            some of NFA.
          </p>

              Name some of your favourite demoscene productions/groups.
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dick:</strong> Sanity, Silents and Scoopex all released outstanding stuff. The
            Sanity "World of Commodore" demo was my all time favourite, I think. Melon were (and
            still are) kings of style - there was nothing quite like their stuff. Makes you wonder
            what they were smoking.
          </p>

          />

          <p>
            There were a couple of apps that were absolutely amazing for the time: zGif was a GIF
            shower that was about 8k in size and incredibly fast, and Stonecracker was a compression
            algorithm that could decrunch over itself, saving loads of memory. I think I employed
            both of those on The Word eventually.
          </p>

            <span class="interview-question">
              The Word was coded using good old AMOS. In three words, how would you sum up AMOS?
            </span>
          </p>

          <p><strong>Dick:</strong> Easy. Clunky. Hackable.</p>

            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dick:</strong> Phil!98, Bootblock, Aladdin Sane and Daniel Thornton are still in
            my ever-decreasing circle. K did a Word article on a Phoebe Cates fake image that got
            into print and he still comes over regularly, but that's about it.

          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dick:</strong> I was never into that part of it. I think I uploaded an issue of
            The Word to The Big Hard One, but that's about it.

            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dick:</strong> This last year (2013) I’ve spent some of my disposable income on
            an A1200 which needs a lot of attention. It came with 8MB in the trapdoor and a
            butchered-in 3.5in HD. It’s really a matter of finding time to play with it, though.

          <p>
            <strong>Dick:</strong> I was, but I’ll be damned if I can remember anyone in particular.

          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dick:</strong> I’m not as busy working as I used to be but I still haven’t
            looked into that. I’m more likely to just hit up YouTube and look for demo videos rather
            than download and run them myself.

            <strong>Dick:</strong> I’m a Web Developer. Aside from client work I run a few websites
            that use either Google AdSense or affiliate marketing to earn an income. It pays enough
            that I don’t have to depend on finding new clients all the time so I’m thankful for
            that.

          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dick:</strong> I like to go camping and have hiked up Ben Nevis a couple of
            times. Sometimes I’ll just throw the tiny popup tent up in the back garden and sleep
            outside just for the hell of it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also do a lot of reading depending on what interests me at the time. I went through a
            lot of books on North Korea last year and have recently been catching up with Iain M.
            Banks’ – especially the Culture novels.
          </p>

          <p>
            UK TV is a bit dire these days and I really don’t watch a lot of that. I spend more time
            watching Japanese and South Korean shows via the Internet – SBS’s Running Man is a firm
            favourite. I also (finally!) signed up to NetFlix so there’s that.
