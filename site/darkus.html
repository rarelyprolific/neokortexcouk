            <span class="interview-question"> Hi Darkus, please introduce yourself. </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Darkus:</strong> My real name, as some of you may remember is Lee Harwood and
            I'm now 33 years old still residing in the North East of England. Better known as
            Nemes!s in years gone by before renaming to Darkus somewhere along the way!

            <strong>FuZioN:</strong>
            <span class="interview-question"> How and when did you find the Amiga demoscene? </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Darkus:</strong> My journey into the realm of the amiga demo scene began around
            December 1993 when I decided to go to a local computer club to get copies of the latest
            games. After a few weeks of filling my disk box with all the latest gems I began to take
            notice of another guy's screen who attended the same club.
          </p>

          <img
            src="img/darkus-interview-devotion01-menu.jpg"
            alt="Devotion Issue One - Menu"
            class="right-aligned-image"
          />

          <p>
            Each week he would have these amazing looking graphics and sounds coming from his
            machine. Being only 13/14 at the time I was a fan of 2 Unlimited (the truth always comes
            out!) and he had what sounded like CD quality 2 Unlimited tracks playing with some cool
            looking sine waves on his Amiga. I eventually plucked up the courage to ask what it was
            and for my own copy. I was astonished it was possible to do this on the Amiga and we
            began to talk further about these kind of productions. (It was U2 by Scoopex by the
            way). We began to speak every week at this club and before long I was getting more and
            more interested in the cracktros on the disks. This guy who I am still friends with
            today was called Messiah and he opened my eyes to the hidden delights of the Amiga demo
            scene.
          </p>

          <p>
            After reading the scrollers in various productions over and over I decided to contact a
            few people. Not really knowing what I was doing I wrote (yes wrote on paper!) letters to
            TBC of RNO and Michael of Anathema. Both of whom replied and from that point on, I was
            hooked!
          </p>

              What are your fondest memories of the Amiga scene?
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Darkus:</strong> Aside from all the fantastic productions, I feel it was an
            honour to be part of such an amazingly talented subculture of some great people from all
            over the world. A lot of people say the scene was already dying by 1995 but for me, 1994
            to 2004 really was a fantastic time to be involved. The magic of it all will stay with
            me forever as well as some great friends I've made along the way. It's impossible to
            explain or for outsiders to understand just how special it was. Although in many
            respects, that's part of the magic!
          </p>

          />

          <p>
            It's fair to say, seeing my name in the Eurocharts and Showtime was always a great buzz
            and the noise when the post man popped a few disks through the letterbox is a very fond
            memory too!
          </p>

          <p>
            Lastly, releasing my own diskmag “Devotion” was definitely a feeling of “I've finally
            reached my goal” type of moment!

            Scene groups: RNO, Anathema, Nuance, Freezers, Digital, Skid Row, Rebels, Nah-Kolor,
            Haujobb, Mangoo

            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Darkus:</strong> Very hard question, but the ones that remain in memory are
            Desert Dream by Kefrens. Laxity is pure genius in this production, code, design and a
            killer soundtrack! Raw diskmag with the legendary Lord Helmet/Spaceballs at the helm was
            the production that persuaded me to begin writing articles. Another diskmag would have
            to be Seenpoint by Scoopex. Fishwave almost single handily wrote all issues and it was
            one of the first mags I wrote for. Other demos, I'd say Nexus 7 by Andromeda, Rise by
            Mellow Chips, Switch Back by Rebels, Chromagic by DCS, Control by Oxygene and most
            productions by Polka Brothers, Jetset, Sanity, Virtual Dreams, Bomb, Complex,.. the list
            could go on forever!!

            <strong>Darkus:</strong> Yes, still in contact with a handful! Wade/Fairlight,
            Magic/Nah-Kolor, Sane/Scoopex, Messiah/Prophets, Michael/Anathema, Genetix/Darkage and
            probably a bunch others I just can't remember right now!! Oh.. not forgetting

            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Darkus:</strong> Working on Devotion diskmag was great fun, having control of
            the content and design/style was everything I always wanted as a scener! (Thanks to all
            the guys that worked on this, Drareg/Ozone, Xenon/Iris, Adam/DCS, Magic/Nah-Kolor,
            Wade/Fairlight, Sane/Scoopex, Teis/Spaceballs, Alvin/Nah-Kolor and everyone else that
            contributed!!) Along side this I always supported other mags like Seenpoint, Generation,
            Jurassic Pack, Showtime, Trashcan and so on. I released a few songs in productions along
            the way, can't remember names now!! In the later years I really enjoyed working with
            Wade and ShanetheWolf under our hidden aliases in Fearmoths.

            <span class="interview-question">
              You were very active in the ascii scene and produced 50 collys. How did you end up
              being part of this crazy subculture?
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Darkus:</strong> Not sure if I can exactly remember where the interest began.
            Messiah who introduced me to the scene was into ascii and I believe he gave me a disk
            that featured a DIR full of bbs adds. I remember looking through them (not even fully
            aware what they were for) and being amazed at these graffiti like style pieces of
            keyboard art. It wouldn't have been long after that I persuaded my parents to buy me a
            modem and I was calling the boards and sending my own attempt at ascii to the sysops for
            them to use on their boards. If I remember correctly I opened my own ascii group called
            Sukmas but I don't think that lasted too long.
          </p>

          <p>
            Groups such as Arclite, Mo'Soul, Epsilon Design amongst a few others always really
            inspired to me to get involved. Made many great friends over the years and a few enemies
            along the way too. I think it was 1997 or 1998 when I started my own group, this time
            called Aerosol and was more successful second time round. The group is still alive
            today... some 16 years later!!

            forgotton! I ran my own BBS “Unity” for a little while using AmiExpress however this
            didn't go down too well with the parents when non-modem callers couldn't get through as
            the modem picked up all incoming calls automatically hehe...

            <strong>Darkus:</strong> I occasionally track back looking at old productions on You

            Starting at 13/14 years old right the way through to 30! A lot of the old productions
            and tracks are linked to memories from those time periods. Like I've said earlier, the
            memories will be a part of me forever!!

          <p>
            <strong>Darkus:</strong> Still have a big passion for music but I can mostly be found
            every day at the gym unwinding or chilling out on the Xbox. The odd binge session or
            bender weekend thrown in for good measure too!

            you can find my parents address in most good diskmags over the last 15 years if you wish
            to send me some snail mail! Please remember to send the stamps back though!! :-)
