            is Lee Harwood and I'm now 33 years old still residing in the North
            East of England. Better known as Nemes!s in years gone by before
            renaming to Darkus somewhere along the way!

              How and when did you find the Amiga demoscene?
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Darkus:</strong> My journey into the realm of the amiga demo
            scene began around December 1993 when I decided to go to a local
            computer club to get copies of the latest games. After a few weeks
            of filling my disk box with all the latest gems I began to take
            notice of another guy's screen who attended the same club.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each week he would have these amazing looking graphics and sounds
            coming from his machine. Being only 13/14 at the time I was a fan of
            2 Unlimited (the truth always comes out!) and he had what sounded
            like CD quality 2 Unlimited tracks playing with some cool looking
            sine waves on his Amiga. I eventually plucked up the courage to ask
            what it was and for my own copy. I was astonished it was possible to
            do this on the Amiga and we began to talk further about these kind
            of productions. (It was U2 by Scoopex by the way). We began to speak
            every week at this club and before long I was getting more and more
            interested in the cracktros on the disks. This guy who I am still
            friends with today was called Messiah and he opened my eyes to the
            hidden delights of the Amiga demo scene.
          </p>

          <p>
            After reading the scrollers in various productions over and over I
            decided to contact a few people. Not really knowing what I was doing
            I wrote (yes wrote on paper!) letters to TBC of RNO and Michael of
            Anathema. Both of whom replied and from that point on, I was hooked!
          </p>

              What are your fondest memories of the Amiga scene?
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Darkus:</strong> Aside from all the fantastic productions, I
            feel it was an honour to be part of such an amazingly talented
            subculture of some great people from all over the world. A lot of
            people say the scene was already dying by 1995 but for me, 1994 to
            2004 really was a fantastic time to be involved. The magic of it all
            will stay with me forever as well as some great friends I've made
            along the way. It's impossible to explain or for outsiders to
            understand just how special it was. Although in many respects,
            that's part of the magic!
          </p>

            alt="Alter Ego"
            class="right-aligned-image"
          />

          <p>
            It's fair to say, seeing my name in the Eurocharts and Showtime was
            always a great buzz and the noise when the post man popped a few
            disks through the letterbox is a very fond memory too!
          </p>

          <p>
            Lastly, releasing my own diskmag “Devotion” was definitely a feeling
            of “I've finally reached my goal” type of moment!

            Scene groups: RNO, Anathema, Nuance, Freezers, Digital, Skid Row,
            Rebels, Nah-Kolor, Haujobb, Mangoo

          <p>

          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Darkus:</strong> Very hard question, but the ones that
            remain in memory are Desert Dream by Kefrens. Laxity is pure genius
            in this production, code, design and a killer soundtrack! Raw
            diskmag with the legendary Lord Helmet/Spaceballs at the helm was
            the production that persuaded me to begin writing articles. Another
            diskmag would have to be Seenpoint by Scoopex. Fishwave almost
            single handily wrote all issues and it was one of the first mags I
            wrote for. Other demos, I'd say Nexus 7 by Andromeda, Rise by Mellow
            Chips, Switch Back by Rebels, Chromagic by DCS, Control by Oxygene
            and most productions by Polka Brothers, Jetset, Sanity, Virtual
            Dreams, Bomb, Complex,.. the list could go on forever!!

            Wade/Fairlight, Magic/Nah-Kolor, Sane/Scoopex, Messiah/Prophets,
            Michael/Anathema, Genetix/Darkage and probably a bunch others I just
            can't remember right now!! Oh.. not forgetting Chromag/Rebels.. I
            still want my Chromagic disks back haha!!

          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Darkus:</strong> Working on Devotion diskmag was great fun,
            having control of the content and design/style was everything I
            always wanted as a scener! (Thanks to all the guys that worked on
            this, Drareg/Ozone, Xenon/Iris, Adam/DCS, Magic/Nah-Kolor,
            Wade/Fairlight, Sane/Scoopex, Teis/Spaceballs, Alvin/Nah-Kolor and
            everyone else that contributed!!) Along side this I always supported
            other mags like Seenpoint, Generation, Jurassic Pack, Showtime,
            Trashcan and so on. I released a few songs in productions along the
            way, can't remember names now!! In the later years I really enjoyed
            working with Wade and ShanetheWolf under our hidden aliases in
            Fearmoths.
