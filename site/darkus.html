              Hi Darkus, please introduce yourself.

            <br />
            <strong>Darkus:</strong> My real name, as some of you may remember
            is Lee Harwood and I'm now 33 years old still residing in the North
            East of England. Better known as Nemes!s in years gone by before
            renaming to Darkus somewhere along the way!

            <strong>FuZioN:</strong>
            <span class="interview-question">
              How and when did you find the Amiga demoscene?
            </span>
            <br />
            <strong>Darkus:</strong> My journey into the realm of the amiga demo
            scene began around December 1993 when I decided to go to a local
            computer club to get copies of the latest games. After a few weeks
            of filling my disk box with all the latest gems I began to take
            notice of another guy's screen who attended the same club.
            <br /><br />
            Each week he would have these amazing looking graphics and sounds
            coming from his machine. Being only 13/14 at the time I was a fan of
            2 Unlimited (the truth always comes out!) and he had what sounded
            like CD quality 2 Unlimited tracks playing with some cool looking
            sine waves on his Amiga. I eventually plucked up the courage to ask
            what it was and for my own copy. I was astonished it was possible to
            do this on the Amiga and we began to talk further about these kind
            of productions. (It was U2 by Scoopex by the way). We began to speak
            every week at this club and before long I was getting more and more
            interested in the cracktros on the disks. This guy who I am still
            friends with today was called Messiah and he opened my eyes to the
            hidden delights of the Amiga demo scene.
