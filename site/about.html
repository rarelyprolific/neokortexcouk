          <h2>About</h2>

          <h4>Who are we and how did it all start?</h4>

          <p>
            The group was originally conceived in 2013 and became nothing more than a few online
            pals <em>(with various skills)</em> getting together and talking about the old times.
            We've known each other since early 2000
            <em>(and known of each other since long beyond that)</em>
            and we were all very active in the Amiga scene. Our collective skills included: coding,
            ASCII, gfx, music and we released various public domain titles in various forms.
          </p>

          <p>
            A Dropbox repository was then created so we could share design ideas, chat about
            possible "future" projects and upload any legacy productions we had.
          </p>

          <p>
            Things kind of fizzled out but the intent was always there to maybe pick up the slack
            later.
          </p>

          <h4>Fast forward to 2018!</h4>

          <p>
            FuZioN started work on a small ASCII colly when he came across a load of logos he
            designed for the group project. This was never released and still sits in a near
            completed state in a dark corner of a HDD. Maybe one day seeing the light!
          </p>

          <h4>2019 (The BIG Bang!)</h4>

          <p>
            After watching the Revision demoparty and noticing how big the ANSI/PETSCII scenes were
            <em>(and how small the Amiga ASCII scene was in comparison)</em> we decided to start
            work on a remote ASCII entry for the NOVA 19 demoparty. This seemed well received and we
            then noticed Versus Amiga Magazine were having a votesheet compo at Edison 2019 Party..
            That went well too! :)
          </p>

          <p>
            zYX redesigned a whole new site for us and is currently reformatting our Amiga Scene
            interviews section. <em>(Excellent work Alan!)</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            FuZioN created a new Fbook page to further enhance social media presence and is working
            on new ASCII releases.
          </p>

          <p>
            Darkus is working on logos for the C64, so these will hopefully be online at a later
            date.
          </p>

          <p>
            The demoscene as a whole does seem a lot more user friendly and approachable than it did
            10 - 15 years ago and it seems that there is more an appreciation for nostalgia and
            actual productivity than creating arguments and flamewars.
          </p>

          <p>The party scene is still as big as ever and this is great to see!</p>

          <p>As long as we enjoy the vibe, we will stay active!</p>

          <p>The future is bright....</p>
