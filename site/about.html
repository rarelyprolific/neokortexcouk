          <h2>About</h2>

          <h4>Who are we and how did it all start?</h4>

          <p>
            The group was originally conceived in 2013 and became nothing more
            than a few online pals <em>(with various skills)</em> getting
            together and talking about the old times. We've known each other
            since early 2000
            <em>(and known of each other since long beyond that)</em>
            and we were all very active in the Amiga scene. Our collective
            skills included: coding, ASCII, gfx, music and we released various
            public domain titles in various forms.
          </p>

          <p>
            A Dropbox repository was then created so we could share design
            ideas, chat about possible "future" projects and upload any legacy
            productions we had.
          </p>

          <p>
            Things kind of fizzled out but the intent was always there to maybe
            pick up the slack later.
          </p>

          <h4>Fast forward to 2018!</h4>

          <p>
            FuZioN started work on a small ASCII colly when he came across a
            load of logos he designed for the group project. This was never
            released and still sits in a near completed state in a dark corner
            of a HDD. Maybe one day seeing the light!
          </p>

          <h4>2019 (The BIG Bang!)</h4>

          <p>
            After watching the Revision demoparty and noticing how big the
            ANSI/PETSCII scenes were
            <em>(and how small the Amiga ASCII scene was in comparison)</em> we
            decided to start work on a remote ASCII entry for the NOVA 19
            demoparty. This seemed well received and we then noticed Versus
            Amiga Magazine were having a votesheet compo at Edison 2019 Party..
            That went well too! :)
          </p>

          <p>
            zYX redesigned a whole new site for us and is currently reformatting
            our Amiga Scene interviews section. <em>(Excellent work Alan!)</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            FuZioN created a new Fbook page to further enhance social media
            presence and is working on new ASCII releases.
          </p>

          <p>
            Darkus is working on logos for the C64, so these will hopefully be
            online at a later date.
          </p>

          <p>
            The demoscene as a whole does seem a lot more user friendly and
            approachable than it did 10 - 15 years ago and it seems that there
            is more an appreciation for nostalgia and actual productivity than
            creating arguments and flamewars.
          </p>

          <p>
            The party scene is still as big as ever and this is great to see!
          </p>

          <p>As long as we enjoy the vibe, we will stay active!</p>

          <p>The future is bright....</p>
