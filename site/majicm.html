          <p>
            <strong>MajicM:</strong> It was Christmas 1989. I was aware of demos
            from a friend who had an Atari ST, and had seen them at his house.
            That really interested me more than the games to be honest, and I
            was actually poised to buy an ST until I saw the Silica Computers
            packages where Amigas and ST's were practically the same price and I
            knew more people with Amigas.
          </p>

          <p>
            There were 3 of us who all got Amigas at the same time and we formed
            a demo group called Liquid Gold. We sucked too :)

          <p>
            <strong>MajicM:</strong> I'm a huge fan of Mahoney and Kaktus, so I
            think seeing Mahoney and Kaktus Music Disk 2: Sounds of Gnome for
            the first time was something that stayed with me forever. I got a
            bunch of demo disks from a PD library to go with the Amiga on
            Christmas day, and that was one of them. The sheer wackyness and the
            fact there were someting like 50 songs on 1 disk really amazed me!

            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>MajicM:</strong> Although I didn't do many intros or demos,
            there were 2 projects I really enjoyed working on. Both were for
            Quartz, one was a party Inftro which had a really nice design. I had
            Paradroid / Anarchy over for the weekend and he did the design and
            we just set to work. I was really pleased with the outcome.
          </p>

          <p>
            The other was "Journey into Divine Madness", my first proper demo.
            It was for the Quartz Summer Conference in 1992 and it came 3rd in
            the demo competition, which I was really chuffed about. It might not
            look the nicest demo or be the most technical but for a swapper I
            thought it was a good effort and so did the other people who voted
            for it!

              Armchair?
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>MajicM:</strong> Ha ha! Well, the day before the Deja Vu
            party I had a guy called Def Base over at mine. He ran a BBS called
            Havok and we'd become pretty good mates. He wanted to go to the
            party so he came to my house so we could make the trip together.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'd borrowed a digital camera from work, bear in mind this is around
            1997 when they'd just really come out. We were messing about with
            it, over a few beers when we had the idea for a pisstake demo.
            Moving a chair around and putting lampshades on it etc! Really were
            just taking the piss out of all the serious demos. The decision was
            made, let's get up to the computer room and start coding!
          </p>

          <p>
            Worked for a few hours on it and it was done. Believe it or not it
            actually won the demo competition but because the party was supposed
            to be PC only the result was fudged. Wasn't really bothered about it
            but it was nice that everyone actually laughed along with it rather
            than at it!

          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>MajicM:</strong> Haha! Well... I'd had a few beers remember.
            I think it was a bit of a pisstake on all the old names of cars,
            GTI, XS etc. At the same time, it was also a pisstake on all these
            serious demo coders with their demo engines, 3D engines etc. I was
            sarcastically suggesting the demo was born out an actual "Armchair
            Engine" :)
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of the stuff I did later on in the scene was more comedy or
            pisstake, I was never good enough to be a proper coder so that
            seemed more appropriate!

          <p>
            <strong>MajicM:</strong> Got my first modem in 1993 and regularly
            called boards like Splatterhouse and Complex Corrosion. I used to
            support some lesser known boards too like Zone-One and Zions Hideout
            when it was a nothing board. In fact, I pumped a lot of time and
            energy into Zions and became a co-sysop. Then a few months later
            when boxing was dead and using calling cards became a no-no I had to
            stop calling the US boards. A few months went by and I called Zions
            on bill and my account was gone and the board was a multi-node
            "elite" board. Zion refused to acknowledge who I was and how much
            I'd helped him turn a nothing board into something. That was the way
            of the scene, people got up their own arses!

            <strong>MajicM:</strong> I did a little in 1993 as a natural

            a few bits and bats but nothing special unless you count "Shape!" :)
          </p>

          <p>
            I stopped following the PC scene around 2000, had more interest in

            <span class="interview-question">
              Cheers for taking part in this interview mate - any final words of
              wisdom?
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>MajicM:</strong> Not necessarily words of wisdom, more of a
            thanks to everyone I knew on the scene in the old days. Everyone who
            was friendly and got on together, everyone I swapped with, everyone
            I met at parties and shared a beer with.... Thank you! The scene
            provided some of the best years of my life, and we made it what it
            was!
          </p>

          <p>Cheers!</p>
