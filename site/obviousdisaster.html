              Hi ObviousDisaster, please introduce yourself.
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>OD:</strong> I'm a lazy coder, creator of crap graphics and
            designer.
          </p>

          <p>
            For my normal boring tedious day job, I'm a software engineer
            (sounds a little more pretentious than programmer), web developer
            and system administrator.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <p>
            <strong>FuZioN:</strong>
            <span class="interview-question">
              How and when did you initially get into the Amiga demoscene?
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>OD:</strong> Must have been 1987/88 when I saw an advert by
            17-bit PD library for a starter pack. It was a three or five disk
            pack and it had the Boing and Juggler animations which impressed the
            hell of out of me. But it was the disk that had the demos that
            really made an impression. I remember a Sunriders intro with the
            scrolling chequered floors and a sine scroller, but then I saw the
            D.O.C Demons are Forever demo. That's what got me interested.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'd only had the Amiga for a few months and I'd mastered AmigaBasic
            (remember how shit that was?) I got a few more PD disks with Seka on
            it and bought the Hardware Reference Manual which was next to
            fucking useless, but I got there slowly. I graduated to DevPac which
            I bought with my birthday money, and then eventually to Asm-One. I
            think I used Argasm as well, but don't remember much other than it
            being incredibly fast.
          </p>

          <p>
            What turned coding from just an interest into obsession was the Red
            Sector Inc Megademo. That was it for me, so I worked like a demon
            copying the effects in that demo.
          </p>

          <img
            src="img/obviousdisaster-interview-gv21splash.jpg"
            alt="GV21 splash"
            class="right-aligned-image"
          />

          <p>
            I went to a 16-bit show at the Novatel where I met Anarchy,
            Slipstream and Share and Enjoy. They were at the foot of the stairs
            right opposite the bar with an Amiga 500 with four floppy disks and
            X-copy copying off demos. I remember seeing Horizon's Sleeping Bag
            demo running on another there. Another memory is seeing SAE's
            Amazing Tunes 2 all over the fucking place.
          </p>

          <p>
            The reason I didn't get that involved in the scene was some of them
            were right arrogant fuckers (especially group organisers), and I
            didn't want to be around them.
          </p>

          <p>
            I knew a coder with the Mighty Druids (whose name escapes me now),
            Dan of Anarchy when he was just getting into coding, Kreator of
            Anarchy and Comrade J/SAE. I knew Kreator because I was a great
            customer of NBS PD library on the Isle of Wight, and they wanted to
            do a monthly magazine and they said Kreator/Anarchy had done some
            code but he was too busy with his studies to finish it off, so I was
            sent it. Not sure if they used it though.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was in a couple of groups, but never produced anything. It's a bad
            habit I still have now, that when the hard work is done on
            something, I move on and can't be arsed with the easy stuff. So
            doing logos for LSD's Grapevine and a few articles was as close as I
            got.

            </span>

          />

          <p>
            <strong>OD:</strong> I have three memories that are surprisingly
            clear in my head.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first is seeing Scoopex Mental Hangover for the first time.
            Woah! This was a game changer. No more megademos, just great
            graphics and music and much easier to code.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second is incredibly geeky, but writing
            <strong>MY</strong> first vector routine. Just seeing a cube
            rotating on the screen without copying or resourcing someone else's
            really gave me a thrill.
          </p>

          <p>
            The third needs a little back story. TEC/Cryptoburners released his
            line source code from Seka, and it was lightning fast, it was THE
            code to beat. It took me months but eventually I made one that was
            faster than his, thanks to someone my brother put in touch with who
            was a maths wizard. That was my greatest achievement.
          </p>

          <p>Tragic waste.</p>

          <p><strong>OD:</strong> Top demos? Oh I have too many.</p>

          <p>
            Kefrens Desert Dreams. Demo perfection for me.
            <em>[Agreed! - fZn]</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            Virtual Dreams Love. Loved Skull's style and demos, and Jogier's
            music is brilliant on this
          </p>

          <p>Phenomena Enigma. For the music.</p>

          <p>Anarchy Seeing is Believing. The music is brilliant and design.</p>

          <p>
            And lastly, anything by Melon Dezign. They were a breath of fresh
            air, with the wild design.

          <p>
            <strong>OD:</strong> No, I threw my Amiga away a long time ago now.
            I used to run WinUAE but lost all my stuff in a hard disk crash. I
            don't miss it that much. I have MP3's of the music that I run off
            Google Music, that's as far as my nostalgia goes now.

          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>OD:</strong> We didn't release anything, ha! Well ok, there
            was a crap game of Tetris called Cybertris, but that was just me
            proving a point to a mate of mine that coding Tetris was a piece of
            piss, I think there might have been a bet involved but I don't
            remember fully.
          </p>

          <p>
            I remember going to High Wycombe for a weekend and me and the other
            coder in the group started coding a demo. 1994 was a bad year for
            disasters, and we were going to code a demo we called Sickness. I
            remember I quickly drew a vector of a ferry as the Estonia ferry had
            just sank, and then we added vector lifejackets and lifeboats
            spelling out Cybertek. I think that's as far as we got before we
            were too pissed and stoned to carry on.
          </p>

          <p>
            Same with the JetPac AGA which I had drawn the graphics for. We
            didn't get past the title page and credits for the same reasons
            above. Why we decided on doing the graphics in med-res is still a
            mystery to me.

          <p>
            I do remember seeing an intro with a light sourced vector face, not
            sure if I had anything to do with it other than the logo. It wasn't
            released as far as I know as we were disabled by having a musician
            who was crap.

            A few weeks ago someone posted a PDF of the original manual for

            play, but then I found I can't remember 680x0 code anymore. That
            pissed me off alot, but probably for the best or I'd end up buying
            another Amiga 4000 that would sit there doing fuck all for years.
